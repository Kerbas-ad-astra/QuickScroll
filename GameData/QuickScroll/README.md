#### What is it?

QuickScroll is a small plugin which adds the possibility to scroll the parts pages, the categories and the filters on the editor with the mouse wheel.

Shortcut:
    - When the mouse is on the part list:
        * Left CTRL + mouse wheel = scroll categories,
        * Left Shift + mouse wheel = scroll filters.
    - When the mouse is on the categories:
        * Left Shift or Left CTRL + mouse wheel = scroll filters.

You can change these Keys on the file: GameData/QuickScroll/PluginData/QuickScroll/Config.txt

I suggest you to look at the awesome mod PartCatalog which also has this feature (with many others nice features).

#### How to install it?

Unzip all files. Put the QuickScroll folder in your KSP/GameData folder.

#### How to uninstall it?

Delete the QuickScroll folder in your KSP/GameData folder.
